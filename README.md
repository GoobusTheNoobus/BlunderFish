I suck at chess so I made a chess engine. I don't know how thats gonna magically make me better, I just wanted to make one. I wrote this in Java, even though I don't actually know a lot of it, I just learned along the way. I first made a design in Python, then switched over to python because the design I went with was horrendously slow. At that speed, it would take a whole minute to get to 2-3 plies into the future. If you stumble onto this be ready to cringe because this is actually one of my first Java code.
