# BlunderFish Chess Engine
Hi, so I'm pretty new to Java, so for my first Java project, I will be making a chess engine. I am pretty bad at writing clean code so if you don't understand my code, congrats, physics are physicing. If you somehow do, tell me everything else that I did wrong. Im not even good at chess, so my
engine is probably gonna suck.

# Completed
- Pseudolegal move generation
- isInCheck, isSquareAttacked, makeMove functions
- canCastle too
- Magic Bitboards; that took WAY to long to figure out
- makeMove function

# Next steps
- Make undoMove function
- Make full legal move gen
- Start the evaluation and searching functions, which I have no idea how to do
